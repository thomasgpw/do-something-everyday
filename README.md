# ABOUT
Do Something Everyday (DSE) is an automated tool for reinforcing goal striving behavior and
tracking the specific goal of doing something everyday. The skill of goal striving is directly
linked to positive feelings of wellbeing. External intervention is proven to be effective as
motivators for goal striving. Collaborative Goal Technology is a previous instance of tools
designed to help patients develop their goal striving skills with an emphasis on building the
patient self determination throughout their rehabilitation. DSE is able to mindfully provide
patients with automated check-ins and caring support at virtually no cost by targeting only the
tracking of daily goal consistency.
